## My stuff

- [Iterations on RSM](https://gist.github.com/samsch/4998dfe7906a0d13cc454592951951bf)
- [RSM - A state management library](https://github.com/samsch/rsm/)
- [Moving Beyong Redux](https://gist.github.com/samsch/8fb704a39733f28247a27c93238a1f1a)

### Experiments

- [A React state management concept (codesandbox)](https://codesandbox.io/s/vq7ozj5rl0)

## State management libraries

- [Unstated](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated)
  - Possibly one of the best current options, but it still uses an unnecessary Class wrapping.
- [constate](https://github.com/diegohaz/constate)
  - Has a good format for defining actions and initial state.
- [(Framework) Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp)
  - Hyperapp v1 is a fantastically simple and direct approach to state management. Sadly, it doesn't scale fantastically for large applications, partially because of needed to "wire" all actions before initial render. V2 is supposed to be better about that, but sadly it means defining actions isn't as clean.

## Other stuff

- [Kefir - a reasonable observable library](https://kefirjs.github.io/kefir/)
  - Significantly lighter than RxJS, probably faster too.
- [Scalable frontend, with Elm or Redux](https://github.com/slorber/scalable-frontend-with-elm-or-redux)
  - A community project to solve the reusability dilemma with Redux.
