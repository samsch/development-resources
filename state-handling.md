## My experiments (old stuff)

- [Iterations on RSM](https://gist.github.com/samsch/4998dfe7906a0d13cc454592951951bf)
- [RSM - A state management library](https://github.com/samsch/rsm/)
- [Moving Beyong Redux](https://gist.github.com/samsch/8fb704a39733f28247a27c93238a1f1a)
- [A React state management concept (codesandbox)](https://codesandbox.io/s/vq7ozj5rl0)

## State management libraries

You don't need them except for specific cases. React's state hooks and class component state are much better to use for most purposes.

For forms, [react-final-form](https://final-form.org/react) is the best library, and is usually worth using for everything but the smallest and simplest forms.

## Other stuff

- [Kefir - a reasonable observable library](https://kefirjs.github.io/kefir/)
  - Significantly lighter than RxJS, probably faster too.
- [Scalable frontend, with Elm or Redux](https://github.com/slorber/scalable-frontend-with-elm-or-redux)
  - A community experiment to solve the reusability dilemma with Redux.
